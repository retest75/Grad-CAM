
# About this project

This is a project about **Grad-CAM**, implemented from scratch without using any libraries.

In original Grad-Cam paper, it implement many method like recognition, segmentation and so on

In this project, I implement **image recognition** and use **ResNet-18** as a pre-trained model ,then take two images for testing.

The first image come from ImageNet, it is a picture of cat.

The second image is my puppy, his name is 樂樂

1. If you want to learn more about Grad-Cam, you can click [HERE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02391)

2. when you see this project, you may see a function named **hook function**, if you don't know **what is hook function** and  how to **register** it in PyTorch, you can see another project **hook function and backpropagation**.
